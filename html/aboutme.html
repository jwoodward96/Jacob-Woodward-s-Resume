    <h4>About Me</h4>
    <p>My name is Jacob Woodward, a 28-year-old Business Management Information Systems student from Reno, Nevada, with a strong foundation in technology and business processes. My expertise includes ERP systems, data security and privacy, database modeling, SQL, and Tableau for data analytics and visualization. I also excel in Excel automation with VBA, flowcharting, web development (HTML and CSS), and IT/IS project management.

        Beyond my professional pursuits, I enjoy cooking, traveling, weightlifting, and enjoying vintage muscle cars. With experience in diverse roles across logistics, customer service, and enforcement, I bring adaptability, problem-solving skills, and a commitment to excellence. My goal is to contribute innovative solutions while continuously learning and growing in dynamic work environments.</p>
